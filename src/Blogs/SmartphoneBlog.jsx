          1. Know Your Budget
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Start by setting a budget for your new smartphone. With a wide range
          of prices, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Define a price range that
          works for you and stick to it, ensuring you're getting the best value
          for your money.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900">
          2. Consider the Operating System (OS)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The two main operating systems, Android and iOS, offer different
          experiences. Android phones give you more customization options, while
          iOS provides a more controlled, secure environment. Choose the one
          that aligns with your preferences.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900">
          3. Check the Camera Quality
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If you love taking photos, the camera should be a key consideration.
          Look for high-resolution cameras, multiple lenses, and features like
          night mode and image stabilization for a better photography
          experience.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900">
          4. Battery Life Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A phoneâ€™s battery life is essential for everyday use. Aim for a device
          that offers at least a full day of battery life on a single charge.
          Phones with larger batteries or power-efficient processors are usually
          better for long-lasting performance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900">
          5. Performance and Storage
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Choose a smartphone with sufficient RAM and storage for your needs.
          For heavy apps and multitasking, opt for a device with at least 4GB of
          RAM and consider a model with expandable storage or cloud storage
          options if you need more space.
